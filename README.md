# Prediction-of-Vulnerability-to-Heart-Disease
In this project, people are classified into vulnerable or non vulnerable to heart disease.
I have performed EDA and removed or altered some of the attributes.
Models fit: Logistic Regression, SVM
Accuracy:  **Test Data: 84%, Train Data: 87%**
**Attributes:**
age
sex
chest pain type (4 values)
resting blood pressure
serum cholestoral in mg/dl
fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl
resting electrocardiographic results (values 0,1,2)
maximum heart rate achieved
exercise induced angina
oldpeak = ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
the slope of the peak exercise ST segment
number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy
thal: 3 = normal; 6 = fixed defect; 7 = reversable defect
